MOF files, which stand for Managed Object Format, are text files that describe Common Information Model (CIM) classes. They are used by Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to define objects like printers or disk drives and are compiled by the mofcomp.exe tool to be stored in the WMI repository. MOF files define the data and event classes that a WMI provider will use. 

Key Functions and Uses

Defining WMI Classes: MOF files provide the structure and definitions for managed objects, detailing their properties, events, and methods. 

Populating the WMI Repository: When a MOF file is compiled by mofcomp.exe, its definitions are added to the WMI repository, making the described objects and their information available to other applications and administrators. 

Extending System Functionality: MOF files can be used to extend and modify the information available in the WMI repository, adding new classes or instances for managed resources. 

Examples in Windows
Standard System MOFs: System-level MOF files are often stored in the C:\Windows\System32\wbem directory and define core system components, according to this Medium article.

Trace Providers: Trace MOF files contain control GUIDs for trace providers, linking them to specific debugging information in a PDB file, notes this Microsoft Learn article.

Security Implications 

MOF files can be used maliciously to introduce harmful classes or events into the WMI repository, making them a target for security professionals and attackers alike.
Detecting malicious MOF files can be challenging because they can be named and located anywhere on a system.
